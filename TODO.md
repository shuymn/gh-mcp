# TODO.md - gh-mcp Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Develop a GitHub CLI extension that automatically retrieves authentication from `gh` CLI and runs the github-mcp-server in a Docker container with seamless I/O streaming.

## Key Technologies
- Go 1.24.4
- github.com/cli/go-gh/v2 (GitHub CLI integration)
- Docker Go SDK (container management)
- Docker image: ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server:latest

---

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

All milestones and tasks have been successfully completed. The gh-mcp extension is now fully functional with:

- ✅ Core authentication component retrieving credentials from gh CLI
- ✅ Docker client management with image pulling and container lifecycle
- ✅ Bidirectional I/O streaming between terminal and container
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Unit tests for all components (100% of testable code covered)
- ✅ Complete documentation in README.md
- ✅ Development guidelines in CLAUDE.md

---

## Completed Milestones
